      <div id="contentarea"><div class="cell text-cell"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 15px;">Ride leaders may cancel a ride if no one signs up online (maybes do not count as online signup) and the ride leader has indicated that they might do this with an appropriate leader comment such as "no ride if no one signs up online" and checks the box on the website for "ride will be canceled if no signups". The cancelation can be posted no earlier than 6 PM the night before a ride and no later than 2 hours before the ride start time.</span><br><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 15px;">What this means for members: Please always check the ride leader comments for a ride you are interested in. The ride leader comments are displayed when you hit the "+" next to the time for a ride in the 7-day ride schedule, and are included in the announcement email for ad-hoc rides. When you see a ride with a comment that the ride will not go if there are no online signups or the tour name is in red font, you should:&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 15px;">Signup online if you are sure you are doing the ride and then be confident that the ride will be held. If your plans change and you won't be doing the ride, please contact the ride leader directly as soon as you can. &nbsp;Please do not uncheck your name and assume the Ride Leader will see it. &nbsp;DO click on the Ride Leader's name on the Ride Schedule to get their email address to notify them directly.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 15px;">Or, check back the morning of the ride to see if the ride leader has canceled the ride because no one has signed up online.</span></div></div></div>

                 <h3>Fast Facts:</h3>               
<p style="margin-top: -15px">Longest single tour: 143 miles from Colonial Park to the Pinelands.  Shortest road ride, 13 miles from Loantaka to Green Village. Off-road rides range from eight to 52 miles.  27 D-terrain tours (and you thought there were no 'flat' rides)?  36 A-terrain tours (granny, anyone?)</p>
                  <h3>Check the ride schedule Frequently, especially with sometimes good, mostly iffy weather.</h3>                 
<p style="margin-top: -15px">We are asking Ride Leaders to post as far in advance as possible.</p>
                                            <h3>Resolutions.</h3>                    
<p style="margin-top: -15px">Let's keep working on three key Club norms: 1) No average pace or PR is worth sacrificing safety. 2) No one rides alone. 3) Choose terrain and pace you know you can ride at the listed minimum average pace. (And RL's: Post the genuine, no doubt about it, pace you expect your group to ride.)</p>

<p>Questions often arise about ride paces...many times asking if the Club offers rides at more relaxed speeds.               Each month we rely on our Ride Leaders to post rides they can enjoy along with those who ride with them. Some RLs like to take it slow, others like to hammer, and many in between.</p>

<img src="/images/stories/public/image_mafw_145.jpg" width="650" border="0" align="middle" height="400" />          

<p>The Club designates "as official" a number of cycling trips or one-day events each year. Both are harmonized through MAFW "event coordinators". However, all registrations and travel arrangements are up to each member. These events and trips are open to all members of the Club.</p>
                        
<p>The Club also organizes and sponsors its own event rides and trips such as the Lehigh Valley Trail Ride, the Lake George Tour, the New Member Ride &amp; Lunch and others that are restricted to club members only (residents of the immediate household of members are the only exception). Non-members of the club may participate in club trips by paying an additional $24 fee to join the club for a one year membership.</p>

<p>The Club designates "as official" a number of cycling trips or one-day events each year. These are funneled through MAFW "event coordinators". However, all registrations and travel arrangements are up to each member. These events and trips are open to all members of the Club.</p>

<p> If you are interested in becoming an "event coordinator" or would like to organize a tour please notify Liz Jennison: <a href="/mambots/editors/tinymce/">drlizjen@gmail.com</a> and it will be added to this list. You do not have to be the MAFW leader on the event to have it listed here.

<p>The Club also organizes and sponsors its own event rides and trips such as the Lehigh Valley Trail Ride, the Lake George Tour, the New Member Ride &amp; Lunch and others that are restricted to club members only (residents of the immediate household of members are the only exception). Non-members of the club may participate in club trips by paying an additional $24 fee to join the club for a one year membership. These are also captured and listed on this page.</p>
                    
<p>If you went on a Bicycle Adventure in 2017 (2018 as we move forward) and would be willing to share your experience with the club, please send Liz a brief write up (photos encouraged).  Adventure write ups will be submitted to the Newsletter editor and published as space permits.  
</p>

<p>Lastly, we have another listing classified as "OTHER ORGANIZATION RIDES" (where there is no MAFW ride coordinator as yet). For those events (which are on a separate page) REFER TO: &nbsp;<a href="/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=157">Other Organization Events.</a> As with Club designated events please notify Liz Jennison: <a href="/mambots/editors/tinymce/">drlizjen@gmail.com</a> for inclusion to this category. </p>

<P>NOTE: All events captured on our Google Calendar</p>
<p><strong>Note: There will be no Sutton, Quebec trip in 2018</strong></p>

A MAFW favorite. This year's host towns are Radford, VA (Headquarters 1) and Claytor Lake (Headquarters 2). Camping and hotel options available. You move your car from HQ1 to HQ2 so you al- ways have access to your vehicle. Two to three route choices per day with distances from 20 to 100 miles. Options to ride 6 days, a 3 day weekend (Fri-Sun) or a 3 day weekday (Mon-Wed). Lunch included daily. Fees $249-$499 depending on what option you choose (prices go up December 31).

The Vermont Challenge offers up to four glorious days of riding with cyclists from across the U.S. and Canada. You'll ride through the picturesque countryside, cross covered bridges, and into historic villages of south and central Vermont. The Vermont Challenge fits a niche between the many one-day rides and those high-end, seven-day packaged tours. It's the best of both rolled into one four-day challenge. Of course you can chose to ride less than all four days, but to truly experience the beauty of Vermont and this event, we strongly urge you to ride with us for two or more days.<br><br>
Saturday's ride is a Gran Fondo, finishing at the base of Stratton Mountain. A brand-new 56-mile route on Sunday August 19, unlike any other in the USA: a road stage that finishes atop the fabled Mount Equinox. Mount Equinox at just under 4000 ft. is highest peak in the Taconic Mountain range and is the longest paved mountain road east of the Mississippi at 5.3 miles. It has an elevation gain of 3,186 ft. with an average grade of 12%. Cyclists riding any of the other new medium or short routes this day will have the opportunity to add this iconic climb to finish their ride.

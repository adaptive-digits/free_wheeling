<h3>MAFW BICYCLE ADVENTURES 2017</h3>            
<p>The Club designates &quot;as official&quot; a number of cycling trips or one-day events each year. These trips are coordinated by Club captains, but all registrations and travel arrangements are up to each member. These events and trips are open to all members of the Club.</p>
                        
<p>The Club also organizes and sponsors its own event rides and trips such as the Lehigh Valley Trail Ride, the Lake George Tour, the New Member Ride &amp; Lunch and others that are restricted to club members only (residents of the immediate household of members are the only exception). Non-members of the club may participate in club trips by paying an additional $24 fee to join the club for a one year membership.</p>
                    
<p>Watch this space for events in 2017 which MAFW members may be interested in attending. If a MAFW member has agreed to be the &quot;event coordinator&quot; their contact information is listed.  If you are attending a Special Event or Multi-Day tour, please notify Liz Jennison: <a href="/mambots/editors/tinymce/">drlizjen@gmail.com</a> and it will be added to this list. You do not have to be the MAFW leader on the event to have it listed here.</p>

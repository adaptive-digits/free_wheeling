<p>The Club designates "as official" a number of cycling trips or one-day events each year. These are funneled through MAFW "event coordinators". However, all registrations and travel arrangements are up to each member. These events and trips are open to all members of the Club.</p>

<p> If you are interested in becoming an "event coordinator" or would like to organize a tour please notify Liz Jennison: <a href="/mambots/editors/tinymce/">drlizjen@gmail.com</a> and it will be added to this list. You do not have to be the MAFW leader on the event to have it listed here.

<p>The Club also organizes and sponsors its own event rides and trips such as the Lehigh Valley Trail Ride, the Lake George Tour, the New Member Ride &amp; Lunch and others that are restricted to club members only (residents of the immediate household of members are the only exception). Non-members of the club may participate in club trips by paying an additional $24 fee to join the club for a one year membership. These are also captured and listed on this page.</p>
                    
<p>If you went on a Bicycle Adventure in 2017 (2018 as we move forward) and would be willing to share your experience with the club, please send Liz a brief write up (photos encouraged).  Adventure write ups will be submitted to the Newsletter editor and published as space permits.  
</p>

<p>Lastly, we have another listing classified as "OTHER ORGANIZATION RIDES" (where there is no MAFW ride coordinator as yet). For those events (which are on a separate page) REFER TO: &nbsp;<a href="/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=157">Other Organization Events.</a> As with Club designated events please notify Liz Jennison: <a href="/mambots/editors/tinymce/">drlizjen@gmail.com</a> for inclusion to this category. </p>

<P>NOTE: All events captured on our Google Calendar</p>
<p>Note: There will be no Sutton, Quebec trip in 2018</p>

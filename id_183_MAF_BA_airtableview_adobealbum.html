<div style="background-color:lightgray"><p>The Club designates &quot;as official&quot; a number of cycling trips or one-day events each year. These are funneled through MAFW &quot;event coordinators&quot;. However, all registrations and travel arrangements are up to each member. These events and trips are open to all members of the Club.</p>

<h3 align="center">Take a closer <a href="https://adobe.ly/2FaWXgX">LOOK</a> for what it's all about!</h3 align="center">
                      
<p> If you are interested in becoming an &quot;event coordinator&quot; or would like to organize a tour please notify Mark Jay: <a href="/mambots/editors/tinymce/">adventures@mafw.org</a> and it will be added to this list. You do not have to be the MAFW leader on the event to have it listed here.  </p>
                   
<p>The Club also organizes and sponsors its own event rides and trips such as the Lehigh Valley Trail Ride, the Lake George Tour, the New Member Ride &amp; Lunch and others that are restricted to club members only (residents of the immediate household of members are the only exception). Non-members of the club may participate in club trips by paying an additional $27 fee to join the club for a one year membership. These are also captured and listed on this page.</p>
                                          
<p>If you went on a Bicycle Adventure in 2018 (2019 as we move forward) and would be willing to share your experience with the club, please send Mark a brief write up (photos encouraged).  Adventure write ups will be submitted to the Newsletter editor and published as space permits.   </p>

<p>Here are two recently crafted articles for traveling considerations: <a href="https://www.mafw.org/images/stories/public/PedalingYourWayThroughTravelInsurancecopy.pdf">Travel Insurance</a> and <a href="https://www.mafw.org/images/stories/public/EngagingaThirdWorldTourGuidecopy.pdf">Engaging a Third World Tour Guide</a>. Feel free to download or contact me directly should you have any questions.     </p>
                      
<p>Lastly, we have another listing classified as &quot;OTHER ORGANIZATION RIDES&quot; (where there is no MAFW ride coordinator as yet). For those events (which are on a separate page) REFER TO: &nbsp;<a href="/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=157">Other Organization Events.</a> As with Club designated events please notify Mark Jay: <a href="/mambots/editors/tinymce/">adventures@mafw.org</a> for inclusion to this category. </p>
                      
<p>NOTE: All events captured on our Google Calendar</p></div>

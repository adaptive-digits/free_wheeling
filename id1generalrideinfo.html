<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f"><strong>Ride Schedule</strong></span></p>
               
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f">Most members find the <a target="_blank" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc" href="/index.php?option=com_7days_new&amp;menu=CM&amp;Itemid=91">7-day ride schedule</a> to be the most convenient to view the ride schedule. Clicking on the &quot;+&quot; next to the time of the ride reveals important information about the ride. Clicking on the tour name will take you to a page with all the details for that ride as well allow you to add your name to the list of planned attendees.</span></p>
              
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f">If you are interested in rides past the next week you will want to look at the <a target="_blank" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc" href="/index.php?option=com_ride_schedule&amp;menu=CM&amp;submenu=schedule">monthly ride schedule</a>.</span></p>
              
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f">Note that the time listed on the schedule is when Freewheeler rides are rolling out of the parking lot. Ride leaders typically gather the group several minutes before that time for the pre-ride safety talk. You will want to arrive at least 20 minutes before the start time so you have time to sign-in, dress and set up your bike so that you are ready for an on time departure.</span></p>
              
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f"><strong>Pace &amp; Terrain</strong></span></p>
              
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f">Every ride has a pace and terrain rating. These categories are explained on the <a target="_blank" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc" href="/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9&amp;Itemid=78#Pace">pace and terrain page</a>. <br />

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f"><strong>Cancellations &amp; Change in Start Times</strong></span></p>
              
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f">Weather&nbsp;(rain, snow, extreme cold or heat, high winds) may cause ride cancellations. Ride Leaders post cancelations by adding a ride comment that includes the word &quot;canceled&quot;. You do this by clicking &quot;My Rides&quot; under &quot;Ride Leader&quot; in the right-hand column of the club website. Find the ride you want to cancel and click &quot;View&quot; and then click &quot;Edit&quot;. Canceled rides will have the word &quot;CANCELED&quot; in red appear after the tour name on the 7-day ride schedule. Ride Leaders should post cancellations at least two hours before the start time for a ride.</span></p>
              
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f">Occasionally, ride start times are adjusted due to weather. On extremely hot days during summer months, Ride Leaders may choose to start their rides earlier to beat the heat. Ride Leaders should make the decision to advance the start time the night before and inform the Ride Coordinator so that a change email can be broadcast.</span></p>
    
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f">Sometimes Ride Leaders choose to delay the start of a ride, for example to let rain stop. Ride Leaders can add a note to the ride comments that includes the exact phrase &quot;Ride Change&quot; by clicking &quot;My Rides&quot; under &quot;Ride Leader&quot; in the right-hand column of the club website, then finding the ride to be changed and clicking &quot;View&quot; and then clicking &quot;Edit&quot;. Similar to ride cancelations, any delay in start time should be posted at least 2 hours before the original start time for the ride.</span></p>
              
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f">It is always a good idea for members to check the ride schedule before heading out to a ride.</span></p>
              
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f"><strong>Guests</strong></span></p>
              
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f">Club rides are open to non-member guests who would like to &quot;try out&quot; for a ride. Guests are asked to join after their trial ride.</span></p>
              
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f"><strong>Minors</strong></span></p>
              
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f">Minors (under 18) are allowed on one club ride, provided they are accompanied by a&nbsp; parent or legal guardian, who must (a) be a member, and (b) stay with the minor during the entire ride.</span></p>
              
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f"><strong>Safety</strong></span></p>
              
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #221e1f">All members should be familiar with <a target="_blank" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc" href="/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=284&amp;Itemid=51">club's safety policy</a>. In particular, a properly fitting bicycle helmet meeting CPSC standards must be used while riding on Club rides.</span></p>

<h3 align="Left">It is with great sadness that we report that our friend and Club Ride Coordinator Ron Brown passed away Friday morning after a long and courageous battle with cancer. He will be missed by all of us. Our thoughts and prayers are with Tracy and their family. We will post information about his service when they are finalized.</h3>
